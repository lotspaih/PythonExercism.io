# Exercism.io Exercises
My personal newb solutions to just a few of the Python Exercism.io exercises.

Probably not the best solutions or the most "pythonic", but they pass the test suite. I'm not actually using Exercism.io the way it's supposed to be used. I'm just looking through the exercises and doing them manually on my own outside the submission system. I skip some exercises, so this is not a complete solutions post.

## Feedback
If you feel the need to give me some constructive feedback on my haphazard solutions, please feel free to submit a pull request. You would have my gratitude for helping me learn to improve my Python skills.
